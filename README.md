Lightning routing node dashboard

Project to manage lightning node. It is still in prototype phase. Almost no error handling.
Many bugs are still present. Programm will crash.

The program has not been systematically tested, but only by using it on Ubuntu.
It has been developed with multi-platform in mind, but this has not been tested.

UI is based on PyQt5 so that needs to be installed.

Use at your own risk, if used on mainnet Bitcoin (money) can and will be lost.

If you find issues please report them in issues.

Thanks.
